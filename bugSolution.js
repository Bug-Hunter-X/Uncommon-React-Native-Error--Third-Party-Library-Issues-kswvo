To solve this, you need to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured. 

1. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that `react-native-awesome-library` is correctly installed:
   ```bash
npm install react-native-awesome-library
```

2. **Link Native Modules (if necessary):** Many React Native libraries require linking native modules. Check the library's documentation for instructions on how to link the native modules.  This often involves using commands like `react-native link`.  For example:

```bash
react-native link react-native-awesome-library
```

3. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:**  Use a tool like `npm-check-updates` or `yarn upgrade-interactive` to check for outdated or conflicting dependencies.
```bash
npm install --save-dev npm-check-updates
ncu -u
npm install
```

4. **Check Package.json:** Make sure your `package.json` file doesn't have conflicting dependency versions. You might need to specify version ranges to ensure compatibility.

5. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making any changes, clean your project and rebuild it.  In Android, this usually means cleaning the build folder.  In iOS, cleaning the build folder and restarting Xcode are often necessary.

By carefully following these steps, you can often resolve issues stemming from misconfigured or incompatible third-party libraries in your React Native application.
