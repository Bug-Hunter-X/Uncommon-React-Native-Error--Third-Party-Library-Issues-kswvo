# Uncommon React Native Error: Third-Party Library Issues

This repository demonstrates a common yet often-overlooked issue in React Native development: errors arising from misconfigured or conflicting third-party libraries.  The example focuses on a scenario where a missing native module or dependency conflict causes runtime crashes or unexpected behavior.  The solution details how to identify and resolve these problems.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file shows code attempting to utilize a hypothetical library (`react-native-awesome-library`) that has a dependency problem.  Without the correct native module or a proper dependency resolution, the app crashes or misbehaves.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution which involves correctly installing native modules and resolving dependency conflicts. This includes verifying package installations, linking native modules, and potentially adjusting package.json to manage conflicting dependencies.
