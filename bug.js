This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly configured or has compatibility issues with React Native. For example, a library might require specific native modules or have dependencies that are not installed correctly.

**Example:**
Let's assume you are using a library called `react-native-awesome-library`, and it has a dependency on a native module that is not installed.

```javascript
import AwesomeLibrary from 'react-native-awesome-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <AwesomeLibrary />
    </View>
  );
};
```

This might throw a runtime error if the native module is missing.

Another scenario is a conflict between different libraries. Two libraries might require different versions of the same dependency causing a conflict.
